"""
This module defines classes for managing enrollments in courses and labs.

The `Enrollable` class is an abstract base class representing an enrollable
object such as a course section or lab. It has various properties and methods related
to enrollment, such as `is_full()` to check if enrollment is full, `sessions` to get a list
of meeting times as tuples of start and end datetime objects, and `schedule_conflict_with()`
to check for scheduling conflicts with another enrollable object.

The `Lab` and `CourseSection` classes are concrete implementations of `Enrollable`
that represent specific labs and course sections, respectively.
